# Ecommerce
I will set up  a webpage where I will offer freelance support to ecommerces.
I will offer them multiple services that may fit their needs in their terms.

UX
I would like to set up a page where they can express their needs and targets.
They may not be technically skilled but I will give them a chance to express themselves in their terminology
Features
I will give them option for their targets and share with them different projects.
I am using Balsamiq for low fidelity mockups. I tried Adobe XD. Even though it offered higher clearity, I do not have the skill yet :/
Existing Features
What i consider is in the future I can offer them different projects and their fixed costs and offer multiple modifications with approximate costs-

Features Left to Implement
Html5 & Css are base but Flexbox,Bootstrap will be used to set up forms, nav bars, buttons and modals..

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.


Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
